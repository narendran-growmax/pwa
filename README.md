# My Progressive Web App (PWA) Example

This is a basic example of a Progressive Web App (PWA) that demonstrates how to create a simple PWA with caching capabilities for offline usage. PWAs combine the best of both web and mobile app experiences, offering users fast, reliable, and engaging web applications that work seamlessly across different devices and can even work offline.

## Getting Started

To get started with this PWA, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Host the files on a web server (service workers require a secure origin or localhost).
3. Access the website using a web browser.

## Features

This PWA demonstrates the following features:

- Caching of essential assets for offline use.
- A basic manifest file (`manifest.json`) for app metadata and configuration.
- A service worker (`service-worker.js`) for caching and handling network requests.

## Usage

You can use this PWA as a starting point for your own projects. To adapt it for your needs, consider the following:

- Modify the `manifest.json` file to include your app's name, description, and icons.
- Customize the `service-worker.js` to cache additional assets and implement advanced caching strategies.
- Extend the functionality of your PWA by adding features like push notifications and background synchronization.

## Testing

To test your PWA:

1. Host your files on a web server (make sure it's served over HTTPS or localhost).
2. Access the website through a web browser.
3. You should see an option to "Add to Home Screen." After adding it to the home screen, you can use the PWA offline.
